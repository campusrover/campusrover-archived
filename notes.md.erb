Fall 2017 Cs119a Notes

* Mbot
  * mbot stage: useful but does it translate?
  * mbot section compressed. Be more specific about the funtionality that has to be demonstrated
  * Make it 2 weeks
  * Or do we need it at all?

* gen0 code will loose its usefulness if we wait too long to dust it off and keep it growing

* keep or ditch ros?
  * some things easier and somethins herder
  * half way option: use it for input and output but not have it dictate the internals?

* Like the team model
* Projects need to wait a little longer when we have the foundation more solid

Week 1-2: mBot
Week 4-5-6: ROS
Week 6-11: CampusRover
Week 12: Project spin offs
