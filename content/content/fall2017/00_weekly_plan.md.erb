### Week 4: Sep 20

#### Individual deliverables for today
* Each student and teacher does a "stand up" report (completed, planned, problems)
* Teams complete the mBot Maze follower:
  * Working on a white/grey table
  * Black electrical tape
  * Level1: Doesn't drive off the end of the table
  * Level2: Actually completes the maze
  * Level3: Best Time
  * Reliable!
  * I will want to video all of them

#### Plan for the day

* Discuss experiences with mBot Maze
* Explain algorithm, opportunities for abstraction
* Volunteer to update the instructions
* Last minute cleanup of code

### Week 3: Sept 13

#### Individual deliverables for today
* Each student and teacher does a "stand up" report (completed, planned, problems)
* mBot programming for line solving a maze according to <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %> is complete and checked into git ready for review.
* mBot programming for solving a maze, with block walls, underway.
* Complete as many of the mBot tutorials as you are planning to look at
* <%= link_to_section :projects, :ros_immersion %>: Begin working through the first chapters of the book and doing the two C tutorials

#### Plan for meeting
* Standups and demos
* Is slack a good way to communicate? Are you seeing my posts? Am I speaking into a paper bag? Remember we are an 8 person team, lets help each other by posting our findings
* Lab notebook format: is it workable? Do you want to make your lab notebooks public? Should we make them part of the web site? Do you all know git and github?
* Look at <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %>
* Look at <%= link_to_project :ros_immersion %>
* Detailed discussion about the algorithms for mazes

### Week 2: Sept 6

#### Individual deliverables for today
* You are offically enrolled
* You have adopted your mBot and have it your custody. It has 3 sensors.
* mBot has been named and has "license plate"
* You have read and done some of the mBot Tutorials
* <%= link_to_project :arduino_immersion %> Complete
* Lab notebook link shared with Pito, Celi and Alex and is being populated
* You have started working on <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %>. You have successfully gotten your mBot to do some basic straight navigation

#### Plan
* Each student does a "stand up"
  * Demo mBot so far
  * Summarize: what finished last week, plan next week, and obstacles in the way
* Discussion
