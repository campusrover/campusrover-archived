### Week 1: August 30

#### Individual deliverables for today
* None

#### Plan
* Welcome and introductions (Pito)
* Discussion about how the course will work (Pito)
  * Review of overall schedule
  * Lab Notebook
  * Projects
  * Our lab
  * Getting help from our TAs (SLACK!)
* Introduction to Robotics (Pito)
* Demonstrations:
  * mBot (Celi)
  * TurtleBot3 (Alex)
  * Building an mBot (Tim)
* mBot Workshop
  * Software installation (Celi)
  * Everyone gets to use a specific mBot <%= link_to_section :fall2017, :studentlist %>
  * Naming of the mBots

### Week 2: Sept 6

#### Individual deliverables for today
* You are offically enrolled
* You have adopted your mBot and have it your custody. It has 3 sensors.
* mBot has been named and has "license plate"
* You have read and done some of the mBot Tutorials
* <%= link_to_project :arduino_immersion %> Complete
* Lab notebook link shared with Pito, Celi and Alex and is being populated
* You have started working on <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %>. You have successfully gotten your mBot to do some basic straight navigation

#### Plan
* Each student does a "stand up"
  * Demo mBot so far
  * Summarize: what finished last week, plan next week, and obstacles in the way
* Discussion
  * Divide up into two groups and discuss the projects
  * My goal is that once we are done with mBot we will start pursuing ROS projects
  * There is a great variety of ways to contribute to the big goal of <%= link_to_intro :campus_rover %>
  * We want to get to a preliminary sense of what people are interested in
* Tim gives the next level of detail of the Arduino hardware
* **LAB**

### Week 3: Sept 13

#### Individual deliverables for today
* Each student and teacher does a "stand up" report (completed, planned, problems)
* mBot programming for line solving a maze according to <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %> is complete and checked into git ready for review.
* mBot programming for solving a maze, with block walls, underway.
* Complete as many of the mBot tutorials as you are planning to look at
* <%= link_to_section :projects, :ros_immersion %>: Begin working through the first chapters of the book and doing the two C tutorials

#### Plan for meeting
* Standups and demos
* Is slack a good way to communicate? Are you seeing my posts? Am I speaking into a paper bag? Remember we are an 8 person team, lets help each other by posting our findings
* Lab notebook format: is it workable? Do you want to make your lab notebooks public? Should we make them part of the web site? Do you all know git and github?
* Look at <%= link_to_project :mbot_maze %>
* Look at <%= link_to_project :ros_immersion %>
* Detailed discussion about the algorithms for mazes

### Week 4: Sep 20

#### Individual deliverables for today
* Each student and teacher does a "stand up" report (completed, planned, problems)
* Teams complete the mBot Maze follower:
  * Working on a white/grey table
  * Black electrical tape
  * Level1: Doesn't drive off the end of the table
  * Level2: Actually completes the maze
  * Level3: Best Time
  * Reliable!
  * I will want to video all of them
#### Plan for the day
* Standups
* Discuss experiences with mBot Maze
* Explain algorithm, opportunities for abstraction
* Volunteer to update the instructions
* Last minute cleanup of code
* Maze running trials (12:00)
* Discuss what comes next
* Live coding demo from Alex (maybe)

### Week 5: Sep 27

#### Individual Deliverables for today
* Complete, documented, githubs for last week in the shared Github organization.
* Watch and do all exercises in lesson 1 and 2 of [Udacity AI for Robotics Course article]https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373/lessons/48684821 Lessons 1,2 and 3, doing all the exercises. Believe me it makes a difference!
* Start working on: <%= link_to_project :ROS_Maze %>
