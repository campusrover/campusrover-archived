1. **Udacity Course** Do Lessons 7 through 12 of [Udacity Course "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics"](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373).

### Standups and Demos

#### Navigation Team: Roger, Sam, Jonathan
1. Explore why we are unable to get another machine to connect to the turtlebot remotely. Will involve some troubleshooting and collaboration with the TA's. Ideally we should be able to teleop using someone's laptop.
1. Figure how to set waypoints and navigation goals in a python script in order to start moving away from manual rviz use and reliance on gui; this is the first step in an autonomous implementation of SLAM
1. Write a launch file for easy turtlebot setup and to take a step toward more robot autonomy. We would eventually like to reduce the number of manual commands down to just one.
1. We will also need to talk to the architecture team about how to represent and report our scripted waypoints (potentially in a yaml or json file)

##### Demos:
1. Remote teleop demo
1. Autonomous waypoint navigation with turtlebot demo

#### Architecture Team: Nishan, Nick, Alec
1. Build off of our node designs from last week and our discussion in class to expand the architecture we currently have planned
1. Implement a teleop node structure on the turtlebot and get it to run.
  1. Including nodes Nav, Driver, Teleop, State and Mux
1. Document each node with the template from last week

##### Demos
1. Working demonstration on the turtlebot
1. Presentation on the nodes we used with explanations of each one

#### New Platform Team: Michael, Hunter, Aaron
1. Explore how realistic building a robot would be; research potential robots (Look through chapters in book about how to make robot).
1. Research potential parts to be ordered to build our own robot. Meet with Tim and hash out what would be a good fit for the scope of our project.

##### Demos
1. List of specific parts to order that has been approved by Tim.
2. Plan of how to use the parts for our project.

##### Topics
* Amazio visit
* Next semester: we will have two "official" time blocks, one will be used like this semester, and the other for teams to work together (in the lab or not)
