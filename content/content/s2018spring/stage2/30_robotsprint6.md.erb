#### Navigation Team: Roger, Sam, Jonathan

##### Goals

* Get turtlebot2 to successfully navigate to a nav goal with obstacles in the way (everyone)
* Work with architecture to remotely set nav goals (Roger)
* Research and implement most effective SLAM algorithms (Sam)
* Have a direction to go with and begin implementing fiducials (Jonathan)

##### Demo

* Demo of turtlebot2 using SLAM to avoid obstacles while pursuing a nav goal
* Joint demo with architecture (Should be able to set remote waypoints)
* Demo/presentation showing our work on fiducials

#### Architecture Team: Nishan, Nick, Alec

##### Goals

* Remotely set navigation goals to the Turtlebot (Nishan, Alec and Roger)
* Adjust the velocity for the Turtlebot's gmapping so it drives smoother (Nick)
* Research building a web API (Everyone)
* Produce a well thought out overall architecture diagram. 

##### Demo

* Presentation on the node architecture we've built so far and how we accomplished teleop override
* Share what we've learned about building an API
* Live demo of the Turtlebot remote teleop override and navigation goals

#### New Platform Team: Michael, Hunter, Aaron

##### Goals

* Build up the Waffle bot with the parts that we have (using old Leonardo parts)
* try to make sure it can turn on to work.
* We would like to be able to have the robot work like a Waffle with Burger parts.


##### Deliverables

* Building new Waffle bot using old TTL motors from Burger parts.
* Alter code in OpenCR to try to have robot function like a Waffle and be able to do basic teleop.
* That is a little ambitious, so if that doesn't work out then we will work accomplishing this as much as possible (may need another week)
