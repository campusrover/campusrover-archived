* Review [Architecture Wiki](https://github.com/campusrover/Documentation/wiki)
1. **Advanced Mazes**:
  * Alec, Hunter and Nick will develop multi-node, "blackboard" based, approach to having the robot navigate the maze. The objective is to design an architecture where each node knows how to do one thing and they collaborate (and compete) on solving the whole problem. If you're interested you-all and I can have a brainstorming meeting on how to solve this in a really cool way! Prepare a detailed (but informal) presentation of your architecture and how you would improve it.
  * Sam, Mike and Jonathan & Aaron, Rodja and Nishan, two teams, will both attack the problem with Slam. The first team will do it with the Turtlebot3, and the second team with the Turtlebot2, if it arraives on time. Also prepare a detailed presentation, with code and demo, of Slam, so that the rest of us can learn from your experience.

#### Lab Meeting
* Discussion
* Demonstrations of the three teams maze running
* Andrea demonstrates the new iRobot Create setup
* Pito tries to explain his blackboard based way of handling the maze
* Decide on next projects and team composition
* Go into more discussion on each team's assignment
* Each team states what they will deliver next week\
