#### Intro
ROS is quite complicated to get up and running, and to really understand. This is a warmup project which will allow students to really get familiar with it in a hands-on manner.

#### Learning Objectives
* Understanding the role and purpose of nodes, topics, commands and services
* Understanding the key components and utilities: ROSCORE, ROSTOPICS
* Ability to write and run ROS Nodes

#### Steps

1. Acquire and read the first 7 Chapters of [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898)
1. Install [TurtleBot3 ROS packages ](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/) on your Ubuntu computer. In the likely event that you don't have an Ubuntu, we have tested the way to get things up and running on either Mac or Windows: <%= link_to_topic :ros_install %>. Whatever you do **Don't try and install ROS on Mac or Windows**. It will make you sad.
1. Write and get to run the WanderBot example from the book
1. Continue reading through Chapter 8, and do as many of the examples as you can
1. Run the similators and move the TB3 with teleop
