<%= homework_hdr %>

1. **STDR**: Do PA1: <%= link_to_topic :hw_stdr %>. Read it closely, there are two sets of deliverables
1. **Programming: Maze** Please do <%= link_to_topic :hw_ros_maze %>. Note that this is a pair assignment, which means that you should work together with someone and have a single deliverable. It's important that you actually really collaborate. And that both people get a good understanding of how things work. Getting comfortable with your teammates and sorting out how to divide up the work will continue to be important. 
1. Read Chapters 7, 8, 9. **PLEASE remember to read the corresponding Ros Talks**: (<%= link_to_section :rosbook, :wander_bot %>, <%= link_to_section :rosbook, :teleop_bot %> and <%= link_to_section :rosbook, :building_maps %>) in parallel and use the code I provided! Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it?


#### Intreresting but optional
1. **Podcast** Listen to this good podcast episode: [Self Driving Cars and Deep Learning](http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/SelfDrivingDeepLearning.mp3). No deliverable.
