1. **Programming: Maze** Please do [Programming Assignment 2: Mazes](https://github.com/campusrover/cosi119a-homeworks/raw/master/CS119aPA2.pdf). Note that this is a team assignment, which means that you should work together with your teammates and have a single deliverable. It's important that you actually collaborate. Getting comfortable with your teammates and sorting out how to divide up the work will continue to be important.
