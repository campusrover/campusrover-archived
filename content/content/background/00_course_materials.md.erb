#### Course Materials

1. [Podcast about Self-Driving Deep Learning](http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/SelfDrivingDeepLearning.mp3) - A really good background about applying deep learning to autonomous navigation. Just 1 hour.

1. [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898) - This is an excellent book that introduces ROS from the bottom up. You should get a copy. Beware, ROS is pretty complicated. It's real-time, distributed operating system which is installed both on the robot and on the controlling laptop (if there is one). It can be quite difficult to configure and finnicky. But it is very very powerful!

1. [Artificial Intelligence for Robotics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373) - A fantastic introduction to the basics of SLAM and localization, doing some of the elementary mathematics that is the foundation of this core technique in navigation.
