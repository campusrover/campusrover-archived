These notes were made by us as we were preparing the course and were the result of reading, experimentation, googling, etc. But, they are not definitey correct!

#### Installing ROS on Mac
This is officially not yet supported. In my experience it is extremely challenging due to very intricate dependencies

#### Python
The ROS install relies heavily on Python. Python is built in on Mac, but it's very possible that you have more than one installed. Maybe you installed it from their web site, maybe you installed it with brew. I have found that you have to be vareful and thorough in disabling all but one Python.

#### Instructions
* [Unsupported Mac Install instructions from ros.org](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source)
* [Supposedly working instructions from github user lubiluk](https://gist.github.com/lubiluk/361a018b267ca4e3ce10cdc68b17363d)

#### wstool and rosdep
These are two utilities that come up a lot as you are getting ROS installed. In a nutshell:

* wstool: from the wiki page: Command-line tools for maintaining a workspace of projects from multiple version-control systems
so it manages source checkouts (ie: clones in git parlor) in a workspace.

* rosdep: from the wiki page: rosdep is a command-line tool for installing system dependencies where system dependencies typically means binary pkgs (ie: debs on Ubuntu/Debian)

So, wstool is used to get the sources of the packages that you wish to work on (or need to compile, if there are no binaries for your platform). rosdep is then used to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed on your system.

#### Where to put your own code
Does all the ROS specific code get installed there? And then if I write ROS code myself, my modules are also kept there? And if I created a new ros_catkin_ws2 it would be fully independent of the first one and possibly / likely contain duplicates of lots of ROS code?

For your second question, no. I usually create a separate ~/catkin_ws for my code. `mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src && cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make` is the usual approach. After that, you'll just `source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash` to use your packages/those that weren't downloaded by wstool.

#### Running Linux on your own computer
* [Here's a good intro to the topic of running Linux on your regular computer](http://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/how-install-linux-on-mac-3637265/)

#### Small detailed tips
* When following the then read the Troubleshooting section at the end it has some great tips
* Important for me was
  * Fix some path names when looking for sip stuff during install `$ ln -s /usr/local/share/sip/Qt5 /usr/local/share/sip/PyQt5`
