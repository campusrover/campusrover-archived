The following list are links that you are expected to use to learn on your own. In the course schedule and other places, there will be references to these.

1. Add info about Arduino Robotics

1. Add info about mBot programming

1. [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898) - This is an excellent book that introduces ROS from the bottom up. Beware, ROS is pretty complicated. It's real-time, distributed operating system which is installed both on the robot and on the controlling laptop (if there is one). It can be quite difficult to configure and finnicky. But it is very very powerful!

1. [Columbia edX Course on Robotics and ROS](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.103x+1T2017/info): This is an extensive and excellent course on Robotics with ROS, the Robot Operating System. I have followed it all and found that it is helpful in many different ways. You should follow the whole thing during the first 3 weeks of the course.

1. [Introduction to Navigation Using ROS](https://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~nardi/Didattica/CAI/matdid/robot-programming-ROS-introduction-to-navigation.pdf) - A PDF from a course from Universittà Di ROma, which has some excellent slides.

1. [Least Squares and SLAM Intro](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~grisetti/teaching/ls-slam/lectures/pdf/ls-slam-00-intro.pdf): Another PDF from the same course.

1. [MIT Self Driving Cars Course](http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu)

1. [Podcast about Self-Driving Deep Learning](http://traffic.libsyn.com/sedaily/SelfDrivingDeepLearning.mp3) - Really good background about applying deep learning to autonomous navigation. Just 1 hour.
