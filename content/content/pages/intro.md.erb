### Introduction

In this course we will be working with Robots. We will be taking steps toward a long term, very difficult goal, which is the "Campus Rover". It will not be finished in one semester! During this first, experimental semester we will be taking the first steps on the journey.

We will learn many fundamentals of building a self-driving robots, and we will actually implement a basic robot. But as importantly we will be working in a way that allows us to pass our work and results to the next group of students who continue next semester. So we will try to follow practices and techniques of code design, documentation, and testing so that the next group will have a solid base to build further.

Hardware: We will be using the XXX platform, which is body without a brain. Or rather the brain (the computer) is empty. It is our job to find, setup and implement the software to achieve our initial goals.

Processor: Our initial processor will be a Raspberry Pi, which is a very powerful and very inexpensive computer used in many embedded applications.

Operating System: Our Pi will be running Linux and "ROS" - the Robot Operating System on top of that.

Programming Language: Our primary programming language will be Python although there will be sprinklings of other languages that will be required as we go forward.
