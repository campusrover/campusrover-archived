* Install VMWare on your computer. You can get VMWare from Brandeis here: [Brandeis Software Portal](https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_mnuMain_child=760fe823-f6c9-e111-971c-f04da23e67f6&cmi_mnuMain=0b2e917e-0b0c-e311-93f3-b8ca3a5db7a1&ws=253068f1-0c11-df11-85a5-0030487d8897&vsro=8)
* Install Turtlebot 3 software on a VMWare VM according to [Wiki](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/overview/) up to step PC Software Setup.
* Textbook: Programming Robots with ROS: Read Chapter 1,2,3
* Read [Martin - Real Robots Dont Drive Straight](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-09/SS07-09-020.pdf)

### Lab meeting

* Overall big picture goal
* Why it's interesting and why it's hard
* Take a look together at the web site
* Take a look at github together
* How did last year go
* Our Robot platforms
* Explain how things will work
* Discuss having a scheduled lab meeting for coding only

#### ROS Introduction
* A distributed operating system
* Not really an operating system.
* A process coordinator and an inter-process communications model
* Different parts (nodes) can run on different computers
* They all need to be connected by a LAN via TCP/IP

#### Nodes
* ROS runs a number of collaborating processes called "nodes"
* Everything starts with the 'traffic-cop' roscore
* Once ROSCore runs, additional nodes can run
* Each node is essentially a serpate program, maybe even a single file
* Can be written in Python or C++
* We will use Python mostly

#### Communication model
* Message based
* Most important model is "publish/subscribe"
* publish a **topic**, subscribe to a **topic**
* Many to many
* Topics have a name (e.g. /cmd_vel)
* Topics have an associated message

#### Resources
* Books (see this web site)
* ROS Wiki
* ROS Ask
